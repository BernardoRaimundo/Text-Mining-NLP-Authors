Text mining is an artificial intelligence technology that uses natural language processing to transform the unstructured text in documents and databases into normalized, structured data suitable for analysis or to drive machine learning algorithms.  Natural language processing  is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence that is concerned with the interaction between computers and humans in natural language.
The ultimate goal of Natural language processing  is to enable computers to understand language as well as we do.  This project can be seen as a text classification problem. Text Classification is one of the widely used NLP applications in different business problems Text classifiers can be used to organize, structure, and categorize any kind of text â€“ from documents, medical studies and file from all over the web. For example, new articles can be organized by topics; support tickets can be organized by urgency; chat conversations can be organized by language; brand mentions can be organized by sentiment; and so on. 
Text classification is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing with broad applications such as sentiment analysis, topic labeling, spam detection, and intent detection This project is intended to be a walkthrough of a machine learning project classification model that is able to predict the author of a specific book/article.
